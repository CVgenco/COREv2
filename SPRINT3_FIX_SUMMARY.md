# Sprint 3 Copula Size Mismatch Fix

## Problem Identified
The Sprint 3 copula fitting was failing due to a size mismatch issue where different products had different numbers of innovation observations for each regime. The original code assumed all products would have the same number of innovations:

```matlab
% PROBLEMATIC CODE (OLD):
innovMat = [];
for p = 1:numel(products)
    innovMat(:,p) = innovationsStruct.(products{p})(r).innovations(:);  % SIZE MISMATCH!
end
```

## Root Cause
Different products have different data availability periods:
- `nodalPrices`: 407,681 observations
- `hubPrices`: 407,827 observations  
- `nodalGeneration`: 126,920 observations
- `regup`: 35,063 observations
- `regdown`: 35,063 observations
- `nonspin`: 35,063 observations
- `hourlyHubForecasts`: 226,871 observations
- `hourlyNodalForecasts`: 743 observations

When regime-specific innovations are extracted, each product ends up with different lengths of innovation vectors, making it impossible to create a single matrix.

## Solution Implemented
Updated `fit_copula_per_regime.m` with robust size handling:

1. **Find minimum length** across all products for each regime
2. **Pre-allocate matrix** with correct dimensions
3. **Truncate innovations** to common length
4. **Add safety checks** for edge cases
5. **Skip regimes** with insufficient data

```matlab
% NEW ROBUST CODE:
for r = 1:nRegimes
    % Find minimum length across all products for this regime
    minLength = inf;
    for p = 1:numel(products)
        currentLength = length(innovationsStruct.(products{p})(r).innovations);
        minLength = min(minLength, currentLength);
    end
    
    % Safety check - skip if no data
    if minLength == 0
        fprintf('Warning: No innovations found for regime %d, skipping copula fitting\n', r);
        regimeCopulas(r).type = 'none';
        regimeCopulas(r).params = [];
        continue;
    end
    
    % Build matrix using minimum length
    innovMat = zeros(minLength, numel(products));
    for p = 1:numel(products)
        innovations = innovationsStruct.(products{p})(r).innovations(:);
        innovMat(:,p) = innovations(1:minLength);  % Truncate to common size
    end
    
    % Remove NaN rows and check sufficiency
    innovMat = innovMat(~any(isnan(innovMat),2),:);
    if size(innovMat,1) < 2
        fprintf('Warning: Not enough valid observations for regime %d copula fitting\n', r);
        regimeCopulas(r).type = 'none';
        regimeCopulas(r).params = [];
        continue;
    end
    
    % Proceed with copula fitting...
end
```

## Additional Safeguards Added
- **Zero-length check**: Skip regimes with no innovations
- **NaN handling**: Remove rows with missing values
- **Minimum observations**: Ensure at least 2 observations for fitting
- **Conditional plotting**: Skip plots for failed copula fits

## Files Modified
- `/Users/chayanvohra/Downloads/COREv2/fit_copula_per_regime.m` - Fixed size mismatch issue

## Ready for Execution
âœ… **Sprint 3 is now ready to run without size mismatch errors**

The fix maintains data integrity while handling the reality of different observation counts across products. The copula fitting will proceed with the maximum amount of overlapping data available for each regime.

## Next Steps
1. Run Sprint 3: `runEmpiricalCopulaBootstrapping('configEnergyCore.m')`
2. Continue to Sprint 4: Simulation Engine
3. Proceed through remaining pipeline steps

## Test Configuration Available
- `test_config_sprint3.m` - Minimal config for testing
- `test_copula_size_fix.m` - Unit test for the fix
- `demonstrate_fix.m` - Explanation script
